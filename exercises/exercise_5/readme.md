# Exercise 5 - Employee Management System

Develop a Ruby program that models an employee management system. This exercise involves creating an Employee class with private methods and a Department class to manage multiple employees. RSpec tests are included to ensure correct implementation.

**Requirements**:

1. Employee Class:
    - Initialize each Employee object with a name, position, and a private salary attribute.
   -   Implement a method to publicly display employee details except for the salary.
   -   Include a method to compare the salary with another employee.

2. Department Class:
   -   Manage a collection of Employee objects.
   -   Implement methods to add an employee and remove an employee by name.
   -   Add a method to display the highest-paid employee among two given employees (without revealing their actual salary).

3. RSpec Tests:
   -   RSpec tests for both Employee and Department classes are provided. Write the classes to pass all tests.

**Task Instructions**

1. Implement the Employee and Department Classes: Create Ruby files (employee.rb and department.rb) and define the classes as per the requirements.
2. Run Provided Tests: Use the provided RSpec tests to validate your classes.
